    <h2 class="heading-page">CHILD CARE SCHOOL</h2>
    <p>
        Helping hand india NGO always believe & concentrated in the fields of Education, Health and Community Development and specially child education below 10 years age. We opened two Early Childhood Care and Development Centers for kids to study and computer learning courses. In these education centers we teach those students who are already a part of Private school or Govt. school. We give these students life education, teach them how to deal with different situations with the help of different kind of physical/mental training and also help them with their homework given in their school. We always work for the upliftment of the poor and destitute by helping them as per their own subject & interest. We do everything from providing educational and health services to the needy and We help those in need with full respect, love and commitment, with the aim to not deliver charity but to empower them to better their own lot. Helping hand india NGO is one of the full-spectrum grassroots NGO in India providing services spanning the development trifecta of Education, Health and Community Development and thus able to provide a comprehensive path from poverty to prosperity and We are committed for same. We have planning to open 50 such centers running in Delhi/NCR with approx. 100 students studying in each center. These children will have packed food every day after the class and also we celebrate children’s Birthday where we make them cut cake and distribute gifts amongst them.
