    <h2 class="heading-page">EDUCATION IS STRENGTH</h2>
    <p>Education is essential to the advancement of a society and Helping hand india NGO is dedicated to ensuring every child receives the education and they deserve. Studies show that a non-educated society is a society that breeds violence and intolerance. On the other side, an educated society promotes citizens who make thoughtful and informed decisions that have a positive impact on their lives, their families, their community and their world. It is the responsibility of everyone to help children and support them towards their education. Our focus is explicitly on the well-being/education of poor women and girls including from tribal and Dalit communities which include programs for their education/health and self employment, so that they can live with dignity and security. We have started changing children’s lives with the launch of our ‘Education is Strength’ Initiative. The initiative aims will provide fees for poor students, their required school uniforms and textbooks for children in need. The program is a merit and financial need based scholarship program that ensures well deserving children are not limited in pursuing their dreams. If you have ideas/suggestion or questions regarding our local work and initiatives, please do not hesitate in contacting us.</p>
