    <p>
        Helping hand india NGO is proud to announce that we are planning our own Old Age Home for neglected destitute elderly persons of hundred inmates, where elderly people, Widows, Handicap and Orphans will be sheltered with sufficient space, homely atmosphere with medical & health care facilities including food/clothing. We will be able to run this old age home with generous contributions from individuals like you and corporate. As you know we are in initiate and with the existing resources it is very difficult to construct the Buildings and we appeal to corporate donors to sponsor for the Building Construction. The name of the Company with an Arch and Culvert can be fixed to dedicate the Building to the Donor. We envision a society where elderly have the Right to an active, healthy and dignified life. We are integrating our programs and services for better development and long term sustainability for seniors. We are contacting with Senior Citizen Associations and encouraging seniors to go ahead in this noble cause.
